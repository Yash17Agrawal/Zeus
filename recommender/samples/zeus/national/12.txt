The arrests were made under Ibrahimpatnam police station limits, some 35 km from Hyderabad, in Rachakonda police commissionerate.
Rachakonda Commissioner of Police Mahesh Bhagwat told reporters that the gang started making fake currency notes of lesser denominations and after successfully circulating them in the market, starting making Xerox copies of Rs 2,000 notes.
The police chief said the accused were waiting for an opportunity to circulate fake Rs 2,000 notes.
Jamalapur Sainath, 28, a butcher by profession, is kingpin in the case and conspired with G. Anjaiah, C. Satyanarayana, K. Sridhar Goud and A. Vijay Kumar to make the fake currency notes.
