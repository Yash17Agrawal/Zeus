Who can categorise George Orwells Animal Farm with Harry Potter? Most of us cant, but Bollywood actor-producer Shilpa Shetty can. The actor has a very kind reason to do so - she has said the book should be included in school syllabus so that kids can learn to love and care for animals.
Shilpa Shetty said Animal Farm, a social commentary on the dystopian society and the Russian Revolution during the Stalinist era in Soviet Union, should be included in school syllabus as it will teach the little ones to love and care for animals. 
Shilpa was speaking to an English daily when asked to react to the recent development of The Council of School Certificate Examination (CISCE) deciding to include Harry Potter series in the English Literature syllabus for junior and middle school students, starting from 2017-18.
I think having books like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter as part of the syllabus is a great move because it cultivates imagination and creativity at a young age. I thinks books like Little Women would also encourage respect towards women at a young age. Even Animal Farm should be included as it will teach the little ones to love and care for animals, the daily quoted Shilpa as saying.
Soon, #ShilpaShettyReviews was the top trend on Twitter India with people posting jokes about other books Monday afternoon. 
 
While one Twitter user said, The Hunger Games is a great series on Karwa Chauth, the best one was perhaps this - Fifty Shades of Grey is an amazing coloring book. Children will love it.
