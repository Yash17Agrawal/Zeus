											 Uh Oh! Never judge a book by its title, should be the mantra to follow here!
The ICSE recently announced the inclusion of books like JK Rowlings Harry Potter series, Tintin and Asterix in school for classes III to VIII. The move, which was made to include contemporary literature books and comics, was welcomed by a lot of students, parents and educationists. Popular actress Shilpa Shetty also appreciated the move, but while at it, seems to have mistaken (and we surely hope it is a mistake) one book for another.
The actress was quoted by an English daily in which she said that reading the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter will cultivate the imagination and creativity of the children to a large extent. In addition, she also had a suggestion to make. According to her, adding George Orwells dystopian novella Animal Farm will also prove helpful, because the book can teach the little ones how to love and care for animals! You heard us!
Of course, add that to those who thought To Kill a Mocking Bird was, well just that, or Lord of the Flies being a book on the fly kingdom, and you have yourself a literary faux pas of the most delightful order in Twitterverse, that is!
No sooner had someone spotted this major blunder, Twitter started buzzing with people reacting to Shettys uninformed statement! Tweeple began tweeting with the hashtag #ShilpaShettyReviews to roast the Chura Ke Dile Mera actress, coming up with their own unique summaries of various popular book titles.
Sample some of the tweets here.
