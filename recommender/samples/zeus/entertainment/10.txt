Expect every bit of grandeur from Sanjay Leela Bhansali and if it is a historical drama, the sets would be nothing short of a visual spectacle. After Bajirao Mastani, Padmavati that brings forth the rich Rajput culture will have a special Ghoomar song, a traditional dance form.
From what we hear, the set of the song comprises of the splendid interiors of the Chittorgarh Fort and the same took about 40 days to be constructed. To retain the authenticity, the makers are supervising every detail and lavish preparations like Rajasthani paintings and about 400 diyas will be a part of the song. Apparently, the team took two days to light them up. Further, for the dance number, professional dancers, fire dancers, Kishangarh and Terahtaali musicians from Jaipur will be a part of the track.
In fact, it is being said that the ghoomar song will be the first to be shot and Deepika Padukone who plays Rani Padmavati has undergone extensive preparations for the same. The actress portrays the character of Shahid Kapoor, aka Raja Rawal Ratan Singhs wife in the film and it also has Ranveer Singh in the role of Alauddin Khilji.
Based on Alauddins obsession with Rani Padmavati, the film is an epic romance drama that is slated to release on November 17.
