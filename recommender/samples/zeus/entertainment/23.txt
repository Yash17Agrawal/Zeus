											 Katrina Kaif went live on Facebook, for her fans straight from Maldives. And shared all that she is doing there.
The fans of Katrina Kaif got to see her live, that too straight from the beautiful Maldives. The actor might be away shooting for a magazine there, but she knows how to send love to her fans. And ever since she made her social media debut on Facebook, Katrina has tried her best to connect with her followersand keep them updated about all the major happenings in her lift.
While on Saturday (November 26) Katrina shared a picture posing in a white bikini, another post on ace designer Manish Malhotras Instagram account on Sunday proved that she is probably the best leggy beauty in the industry.
On Sunday evening, Kat did a Facebook live and shared all that she was doing in Maldives, the resort she is staying in and also the beautiful beach just outside her room. Katrina feels that next time when she is travelling to Maldives she should have someone giving her company as the room next to hers is vacant.
