She had none, in fact, until recently, when she decided to make her fans on Facebook go crazy.Taking it a step further, Katrina--who was in Maldives over the weekend to shoot for Harper's Bazaar Bride with Manish Malhotra--got in touch with her fans through Facebook Live (live video streaming via Facebook).
