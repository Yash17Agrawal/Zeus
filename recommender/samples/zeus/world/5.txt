Fidel Castro has died at the age of 90. The Communist revolutionary's death was announced on Cuban state television in the early hours of Saturday. Castro had been in poor health since an intestinal ailment nearly killed him in 2006 and he formally ceded power to his younger brother Raul Castro two years later. Wearing an olive coloured military uniform, Raul Castro appeared on state television to announce his brother's death. Cuba announced nine days of national mourning - but in Miami there were celebrations as Cuban Americans whose families left the restrictive regime took to the streets.

 Before his 90th birthday in August, Fidel Castro told supporters he was going to die soon. The bearded Fidel Castro took power in a 1959 revolution and ruled Cuba for 49 years with a mix of charisma and iron will, creating a one-party state and becoming a central figure in the Cold War. He was demonised by the United States and its allies but admired by many leftists around the world, especially socialist revolutionaries in Latin America and Africa.

 Transforming Cuba from a playground for rich Americans into a symbol of resistance to Washington, Castro outlasted nine U.S. presidents in power. He fended off a CIA-backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs in 1961 as well as countless assassination attempts. Wearing green military fatigues and chomping on cigars for many of his years in power, Castro was famous for long, fist-pounding speeches filled with blistering rhetoric, often aimed at the United States.

 At home, he swept away capitalism and won support for bringing schools and hospitals to the poor. But he also created legions of enemies and critics, concentrated among Cuban exiles in Miami who fled his rule and saw him as a ruthless tyrant. When he closed the twice-a-decade congress of the Cuban Communist Party in April he called on his countrymen to maintain socialist ideals in the face of closer ties with the US.

 Castro's last appearance in public was at an event to mark his birthday. As President Barack Obama moved to heal relations with Havana, Castro responded: We don't need the empire to give us anything.
