Brigadier Peter Elwelu, the UPDF 2nd Division Commander, defended the army's attack on the palace.He said Omusinga Mumbere had been given an ultimatum of two hours to surrender the royal guards from the palace.Just startedElwelu said the king was told to remain with only nine royal guards, a directive he did not heed, forcing the army to launch an offensive on the palace.We gave him two hours to hand over all the guards at his palace but he did not cooperate with us, so we had to swing into action and get them out forcefully.Elwelu said further that the attack on Mumbere's palace wouldn't have occurred had the monarch adhered to the directives from the state. He also described the actions of the royal guards as those of a terrorist group destabilizing the region.The operations in the district will continue and the camps belonging to the royal guards will be razed down, he added.The operations have just started. We want to ensure that we disband all their camps which they had set in the mountains of Rwenzori so that peace can be restored.
