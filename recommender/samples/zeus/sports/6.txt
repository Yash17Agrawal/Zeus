Over 38 | Score 71/3 | (Root 36*, Batty 0*)
STUMPS: Ashwin picked his third wicket of the innings when Stokes was trapped in front of the wicket. The umpire wasn't convinced but a confident Kohli went for the review which got him a big wicket. Root, the lynchpin of this batting attack once again has the onus on his shoulders to steady the ship. The visitors now trail by 56 runs with six wickets remaining.

Jayant Yadav picked the wicket of Bairstow, who edged a delivery which kept very low and Parthiv Patel held on to an excellent catch. India are in control of the match now. Ben Stokes is the next man in. He needs to play a different role for his team in this innings, which is to save the Test match.

Ashwin picked his second wicket of the innings as he deceived Ali in flight and he gave an easy catch towards mid-on. Soft dismissal. Jonny Bairstow is the new man in. He has been fine form for his team this year and he needs to stitch a partnership with Root.

R Ashwin, Kohli's go-to man, got India the first breakthrough as he breached through Cook's defensed to bowl him. Cook misjudged the line of the delivery and it went between his bad and pad to hit the stumps. Earlier, DRS saved Cook after he was declared lbw off Ashwin's bowling.

Over 138.2 | Score 406/8 | (Jayant 50*, Umesh 8*)
Ben Stokes dismissed Jayant and Umesh to bowl India out for 417 runs. The lower order batsmen have put a great show for the Indian team. India lead by 134 runs and the team managenment would be very happy with that effort.

Over 135 | Score 406/8 | (Jayant 50*, Umesh 8*)
Jayant Yadav, who looks like a very matured cricketers, continued to impress as he slammed his maiden Test fifty. Like a pro, Jayant has played brilliantly since his arrival at the crease. Just like Ashwin, India have found another lower order batsman who has all shots in his repertoire. India now lead by 123 runs.
Over 124 | Score 381/8 | (Jayant 33*, Umesh 0*)
Jadeja's brilliant knock came to an end as he tried hitting a six off Adil Rashid but was caught at long-on by Woakes. Fine innings. Umesh Yadav is the new man in. India lead by 98 runs with two wickets remaining.

Over 122 | Score 379/7 | (Jadeja 89*, Jayant 32*)
Jadeja stepped down the gas in Woakes' 24th over where he hit him for three consecutive boundaries off the first three balls. After blocking the next two balls, Jadeja hit another boundary past midwicket. He moves to 89 and the partnership swells to 78 runs. Frustrating times for England camp.
Over 114 | Score 354/7 | (Jadeja 70*, Jayant 26*)
India's session. Jadeja has been batting brilliantly and after a 97-run partnership with R Ashwin, he has now added unbeaten 53 runs with Jayant Yadav, who continues to impress as a batsman. These partnerships are hurting England badly, after they had picked Kohli's wicket at the score of 204 runs. India now lead by 71 runs with three wickets remaining.
Over 100 | Score 320/7 | (Jadeja 50*, Jayant 15*)
Jayant Yadav is once again batting very sensibly, like a pro. He has already hit two boundaries and is once again unleashing some quality strokes. Virat Kohli and Anil Kumble would be very happy to have another sensible and mature cricketer in the playing XI. Jadeja, on the other hand, is playing one of the most memorable knocks of his Test career.
Over 95 | Score 301/7 | (Jadeja 46*, Jayant 0*)
Ben Stokes got the first breakthrough of the day for England when Ashwin chased down a wide ball and hit it straight to the fielder at point. Ashwin wasn't happy with himself but the visitors have finally got the much-needed breakthrough. Jayant Yadav is the new man in. He batted sensibly at Vizag and expectations are now high with him. Ashwin and Jadeja added 97 runs for the seventh wicket partnership.
R Ashwin c Buttler b Stokes 72 (113b)
Over 90 | Score 290/6 | (Ashwin 64*, Jadeja 43*)
Ashwin and Jadeja have continued the good work. They have started the day with a positive mindset. India now lead by seven runs and these two have consolidated the lead to 86 runs for seventh wicket.
Day 2 Recap:
Indian batsmen, including flamboyant and in-form skipper Virat Kohli, were made to toil hard before Ravichandran Ashwin's counter-attacking 57 enabled the hosts to reach 271/6 at stumps on the second day.
India are only 12 runs behind England's first innings score of 283 after the visitors added 15 to their overnight tally of 268 for 8.
It was an intriguing day of Test cricket and hosts can claim that their nose is slightly ahead thanks to the 67-run stand for the 7th wicket between Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, who also smashed a quick-fire 31 not out off 59 balls.
India's 'Man Friday' was Ashwin, who again played his part albeit with the willow reaching his 9th half-century in Test cricket.
Ashwin's sequence of scores in the series reads 70, 32, 57, 7 and 57 not out (ongoing). His innings was studded with eight fours off 81 balls. Jadeja's knock had three fours and a six.
The day's play can be called a battle of attrition with skipper Kohli curbing his aggressive stroke-play, having read the pitch really well during his patient 62 off 127 balls.
