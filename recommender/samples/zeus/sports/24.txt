FULL TIME: Delhi Dyanmos 5-1 FC Goa
We are slowly sauntering across to the end.
90'+1'
We are into added time with both teams wanting to get this over with now.
88'
Reinaldo down the left tries to float it to the far post towards Gaikwad on the overlap but it only reaches Souvik who heads it out only to Tavora who cannot keep his shot on goal as it is flashed wide.
87'
Kean Lewis continues Debabrata's torment as he goes past him and puts a delightful cross into Badji but he cannot shoot there
85'
Kean Lewis finds space down the right but unlike Marcelinho he fails to find the far post as he tries to find the far corner.
84'
Raju slips it forward to Tavora down the right but he cannot go past Souvik and co. Raju with a long throw in but that is only towards Tebar! Debabrata has the ball though and he plays it on to Fulganco whose shot though is saved easily by Poirei this time.
82'

Marcelinho tries to come down the right yet again and he almost finds Kean Lewis there but Gaikwad comes in the way and this was it for tonight's hero as Pelissari comes on in.
79'
Cesar with a free-kick from about 25 yards out and he again puts it over. Meanwhile Balmuchu comes on for Keenan. Niasse gives away a corner as Cesar was looking to get into the box.

Lewis and Badji look to exchange passes and get in from the left but Keenan gets it away finally.
74'
Delhi look complacent with their 4 goal lead and look to play the ball around with ease. Goa too look to press but Delhi have no problem at all. Tebar tries to hook it forward to Lewis but Luciano gets it out.
70'

Substitution Richard Gadze Badara Badji
70'
OOOOH! Delhi's corner is headed out by Gaikwad but it falls to substitute Badji who tries to smash it into the far corner but that has gone high and wide! That was his first shot of the match.
69'
Addy is again on the overlap and his cross into the box is defended out by Keenan! Meanwhile Zambrotta puts in Badji instead of Gadze.
67'
SubstitutionPratesh Shirodkar

67'
Anas tries to go forward with the ball but he only manages to down Tavora. Zico meanwhile takes out Pratesh and puts in Trindade.
64'
David Addy seems to be unlucky today. Gadze tries to play an one two with Addy trying to put him in but Keenan brings him down. But the referee is not interested.
63'
Kean Lewis picks up the ball on the left and tries to pick out Marcelinho but Gaikwad heads it out and Milan Singh takes it back and tries to build a move again.
61'
POOR! Cesar's freekick neither had no direction as that goes into orbit.
60'

Substitution Richarlyson Barbosa Felisbino Rafael Dumas Ribeiro
60'
Meanwhile respite for Goa as Cesar is fouled by Milan Singh. Goa meanwhile bring on Dumas instead of Richarlyson but they have already been battered here.
58'
What exactly is HAPPENING HERE? Delhi are now 5-1 now. GADZE! It's Tebar again who plays a brilliant long ball that sees Gadze go past Raju with ease and then finish it easily past Kattimani! GOOD LORD

GOOD LORD! MARCELINNNNNNNNNNNHO IS ON ANOTHER PLANET NOW! Marcos Tebar plays a fine diagonal ball from the defense that sees Marcelinho skin Roy taking him inside and then outside adn then powers a ball past Kattimani towards the far post with his right foot! HAT-TRICK
54'
Delhi are really enjoying this now. Addy on an overlapping run and he passes it to Malouda who tries to find Gadze who wants to turn on the ball but they get the ball out before a long ball in towards Marcelinho sees him marginally offside.
53'
CHANCE! Luciano gets on the ball after a poor clearance off a Goa corner but his shot towards the near post hits the sidenetting much to the relief of Rocha who was tasked with marking him

Goal Richard GadzeGoal Richard Gadze
51'
GOAAAAAAAAAAAAL! Delhi are turning on the style and it's all Gadze here! He shows raw pace and raw power there as he goes onto Marcelinho's pace and accelerates past Gaikwad as if he was not there before smashing it to Kattimani's near post. Although that did have a lot of power on it Kattimani should have saved that.
51'
Keenan Almeida on the overlap on a rare Goa attack but his cross into the box is poor as it is too deep and in no man's land.

48'
WHAT A FANTASTIC SHOT! From nowhere Marcelinho conjures a moment of magic there! Delhi are 2-1! GOAAAAAAAAAAAL! he takes the ball in the centre about 25 yards out, goes past Richarlyson with no pressure at all and just has a go from there and it is a rasping drive that gives Kattimani no chance as it strikes the post and goes in.
47'
Meanwhile Marcelinho again slides it sideways to Gadze but he does not have anywhere to go and he has to go back and the move ends when Souvik loses the ball and gives away a foul against Richarlyson
47'
So Gaikwad ends up crashing into Gadze and gives away a foul about 30 yards down the right and Tebar swings it in and no one comes to reach it and it again almost falls to Gadze.
45'
And we have kicked off for the second half.
It has been an interesting half with Delhi the dominant side but Goa were the ones who had taken an unlikely lead.
HALF TIME: Delhi Dynamos 1-1 FC Goa
45'+1'
Marcelinho again free down the right and hangs up a cross that is headed out by Gaikwad but it falls to Lewis whose snapshot is again headed out by an alert Gaikwad. Marcelinho again leaves Roy on the ground but he does get a foot in at last and Delhi have another corner. Malouda lifts it in and it comes back to Gadze who tries to turn and shoot but Kattimani can hold on.
45'
WAS THAT A FOUL? Malouda tries to fling it on to the path of an overlapping Addy but Tavora brings him down just outside the box. Referee is not interested though.
43'
Ruben gets in the way of the pass from Reinaldo as he was again looking for Cesar and it's Delhi's ball. But Gadze finally gives it away to Richarlyson before Roy returns the favor and Tebar intercepts.
42'
Kean Lewis again in the fray and this time he is back and hangs up a ball towards Gadze who goes behind Gaikwad and jumsp and chests it but the linesman puts his flag up for a handball offense.
40'
Delhi have another freekick with Tebar lining up to put it in. Kean Lewis tries to flick it on but Rocha has ended up fouling someone there. A mini scuffle has broken out with Anas livid with something.
39'
Off the restart Marcelinho is again racing down the right and hangs a ball up to the far post but it is just away from Malouda.
38'

38'
Shirodkar with a poor foul and Delhi have a freekick with Malouda standing over it. That was a training ground move with Malouda choosing to slide a through ball pas the wall finding Marcelinho's perfect diagonal run down the left and he can flick it past Kattimani with the ball nestling the far corner.
36'
Yellow Card Pratesh ShirodkarYellow card Pratesh Shirodkar
34'
Another great pass by Gadze who drops back and plays a perfect through ball noting Marcelinho's precise run but his shot is again saved by Kattimani who is clearly alert!
33'
On the other end Gadze again makes space for himself from the edge of the box and smashses it towards goal but Kattimani gets a hand to it and palms it out but it falls to Lewis who picks up the pieces and pings in a cross in the box that Kattimani can haplessly flap it away. Marcelinho recovers and tries to place a shot on goal but that has gone straight to Kattimani!
31'
Goal Fulganco CardozoGoal Fulganco Cardozo
31'
GOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL! Bizarre. How did that happen? It's Julio Cesar with some great strength again with him making a perfect diagonal run that is found out by a neat pass from Reinaldo. With Anas beside him he holds the ball up and takes it past Poirei before his attempt to slide it into the empty net from a rather acute angle sees Poirei recovering on time to palm it away BUT only to the path of Cardozo who has a tap in!
31'
Souvik on the overlap but like it has been for the 30 minutes or so the cross into the box is poor as it is completely overhit.
29'
Debabrata on the overlap does well to get it away from Souvik Chakraborty but his cross into the box is too deep and Kean Lewis can retrieve.
28'
Gadze looks to play it forward to Malouda but Reinaldo has come back and gets the ball away from him but his attempt to pass it to Cesar is stopped by Rocha who intercepts on time.
27'
Meanwhile Goa have a freekick with Richarlyson standing on it down the right. It's no problem for Tebar to head it out and Delhi break through Marcelinho down the right but his cross into the box takes a deflection off Debabrata and Kattimani can hold on.
25'
Marcelinho does ever so well as he goes streaming down the right, on the byline and hops a ball in but Gaikwad gets a head to it before Gadze can pounce! The move breaks down as Milan ends up fouling Richarlyson in trying to retrieve it.
22'
HOW WAS THAT MISSED? Cesar does ever so well to put in a lovely little ball floated at the far post. Cardozo who has overlapped gets a head to it but that's gone across the face of the goal and is too high for Reinaldo to reach. Cesar comes himself in the far post but does not have room to get a shot out! CHANCE WASTED
21'
CHANCE! Sahil TAVORA! He does well to come into the middle with no one tackling him and he tries to find the far corner but Poirei gets a hand to it and tips it wide. Goa fail to keep the ball in the box as Delhi clear off the corner.
20'
Poor freekick there as that has gone nowhere. Meanwhile Gadze tries to head it onto the path of Malouda but Luciano is upto the task there.
19'
Delhi again try to go down the middle but Keenan upends Malouda with a high foot before Luciano clatters into Gadze. Delhi have a freekick.
16'
MALOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUDAAAAAA! No he just smashes it over from about 30 yards out. Kattimani is not troubled.
13'
Goa attack down the left this time but nothing comes of it as Richarlyson's attempted cross in is easily defended by Anas
11'
Souvik has the ball and he has overlapped and is down the throat of the Goa defense. No one is closing him down and he tries to pick out Gadze down the left but that is overhit. Delhi break again through Milan but he cannot go past Gaikwad there.
CHANCE! Delhi are tearing Goa apart. Marcelinho skips past three Goa players starting from Richarlyson but instead of squaring it to the far corner where Gadze is free he tries to shoot from an acute angle and it's only the side netting! SELFISH.
AND AGAIN! Gadze is through following a brilliant ball from Marcelinho that bisects the defense but his shot is blocked by Sobrosa and co. who do well to close him down before Roy can hack it clear.
Ooooh! That was almost sucidal by Debabrata. He fails to hold on to a regulation back pass and Gadze can get on to it and goes down the left but Roy comes back and makes amends with a sliding tackle.
Julio Cesar does ever so well to shield the ball from Anas and plays it back to Gaikwad but his cross field ball has gone in no man's land.
Oooooooooooh! Reinaldo is barged out of the ball by Rocha before Tebar lifts it forward with a lovely lofted through ball that Gadze cannot connect in the air as he tries to volley it towards goal.
And Kean Lewis is again played on after Marcelinho and Malouda exchange passes but Luciano Sobrosa is there and hacks it out.
Poor defending from Keenan Almeida there. Completely misses the clearance allowing Kean Lewis through but somehow recovers before Tavora does well to avert the danger.
Florent Malouda with a through ball towards Marcelinho and that was inches away there...but Kattimani holds on.
Goa have an early freekick down the right as Milan Singh barges into Richarlyson. Raju Gaikwad pings it forward.
And we have kicked off
The national anthems are on and we are just about ready to go.
Interestingly Robin Singh who had scored for Delhi against Goa last year sits out and Cesar and Reinaldo are upfront. Tavora and Shirodkar too come in the midfield with Trindade and Rafael dropped. Meanwhile Dumas and Arnolin too are out.
FC Goa XI: Kattimani (GK); Luciano, Gaikwad, Cardozo; Debabrata, Keenan; Richarlyson, Tavora, Shirodkar; Reinaldo, Cesar
Delhi Dynamos XI: Poirei (GK); Souvik, Anas, Ruben, Addy; Malouda, Tebar, Milan; Marcelinho, Gadze, Kean Lewis
Before we get down to the nitty gritty here are the lineups.
Follow LIVE commentary as Delhi Dynamos line up against FC Goa in a bid to improve their position on the table but for Goa it will be only a morale boost as they are out of contention for the play-off positions.
