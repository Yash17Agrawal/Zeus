 Joses Pogba fury justified?
 
 
 Jose Mourinho could face a two-match ban after being sent to the stands during Manchester United's 1-1 draw with West Ham in the Premier League on Sunday.
 Mourinho received his marching orders for the second time in three home league games after kicking out at a water bottle on the touchlineat Old Trafford and then declined to speak to the media at the end of the match.The Special One, who was sent to the stands during last month's goalless draw against Burnley, reacted after Paul Pogba was booked for diving shortly before the half-hour mark Mourinho felt Pogba should have been given a free-kick but referee Jon Moss ruled there was no contactand showed the French international a yellow card.The Portuguese was banned from the touchline for one match, fined 8,000 and warned as to his future conduct by the Football Association following the Burnley incidentand faces the possibility of a stiffer penalty for his latest transgression.The referee explained it to Jose and there is nothing more to say,United's assistant manager RuiFaria said after the match.I think there was frustration from Jose after the yellow card for Pogba. It should be a foul for us but the referee understood it in another way.I think everyone saw it but it is part of the game. It was the referee's decision. Manchester Utd 1-1 West Ham Pogba will now miss United's next game, anEFL cup clash with West Ham, while Mourinho is likely to face further punishment from the Football Association for his outburst.The United boss also received a 50,000 fine earlier this month for comments about the appointment of Anthony Taylor to referee their game against Liverpool. Mourinho, 53, previously had a run-in with Moss during the final weeks of his tenure as Chelsea manager 12 months ago when he was also sent to the stands during a 2-1 defeat to the Hammers and handed a one-game ban.The latest result was United's fourth successive home draw in the league - a sequence they have not endured since 1980 - while their points return from 13 games, 20, is their worst since 1989-90.Upgrade to Sky Sports now and get 12 months half price.
