At least 113 people died in 2015-16 due to botched sterilisation surgeries, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Anupriya Patel told the Lok Sabha on Friday. Yes, Patel said when asked whether the government is aware that botched up sterilisation surgeries in the previous fiscal claimed at least 113 lives, and that the death rate is at par with countries such as Bangladesh and Indonesia.
		
	
In a written reply, Patel stated that 19 people died in Maharashtra, and 14 people each died in Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. The steps taken by the government include upgradation of guidelines on standards and quality assurance in sterilisation services and dissemination of standards to all states through workshops, she said.
Patel said the Supreme Court had laid stress on the need to strengthen primary health centres in a time-bound manner, and that the government has accordingly issued detailed guidelines to all states.
