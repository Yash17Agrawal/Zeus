Controversial meat exporter Moin Qureshi has returned to India and was questioned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for more than five hours on Tuesday.
He might be questioned again, said agency sources.
The ED had registered a case against Qureshi under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) last year. He is under the scanner of probe agencies for alleged tax evasion and hawala-like dealings following the Income Tax raids on his premises.
Qureshi had left India under mysterious circumstances on October 15.
The ED had issued a look out circular (LOC) against him, asking immigration authorities to stop him and inform it whenever Qureshi tries to leave the country.
When Qureshi reached the Indira Gandhi International airport on October 15, he was stopped due to the LOC and the ED was informed. 
However, Qureshi told the authorities he had a court order on the basis of which he could leave the country. 
He also got the order faxed at the airport for the perusal of the immigration authorities.
But the order pertained to a separate case lodged by the Income Tax department against Qureshi, which said he could leave the country merely by informing the court.
After reviewing the court order, the immigration officials at the airport allowed him to leave. The immigration authorities termed the incident a bonafide mistake.
The agency had also asked the CBI to probe the role of public servants in allegedly favouring Qureshi in his deals.
