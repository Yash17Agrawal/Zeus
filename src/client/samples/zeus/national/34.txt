This prompted the officials to allow him to fly abroad without due diligence.The agency had slapped fresh charges under PMLA after taking cognisance of the I-T departments charge sheet against Qureshi in a tax evasion case in a local court. The ED was probing this case earlier under forex violation laws after the I-T department first shared documents indicating hawala and contravention of forex laws by him and his business entities based here.The ED had claimed that Qureshi sent huge amount of funds through hawala route to Dubai, London and few other overseas destinations in Europe.Qureshi was in the eye of a storm last year for his links with former CBI Director Ranjit Sinha. He had visited Sinha some 90 times, according to the entries in visitors log.He was also under the scanner of the I-T department for his connections with another former CBI director A P Singh. The telephone calls between Singh and Qureshi showed that their relationship was deep.
