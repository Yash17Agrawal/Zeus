			Mumbai: So the buzz is that a certain Mr. Ahuja has swept our Khoobsurat star off her feet and, despite trying their best, the alleged couple fails to keep under wraps.
Yes, after been photographed on numerous occasions from social gatherings to outings with friends the rumoured love birds were caught on camera again, Sonam happily posing for the camera while Anand looks away.
Anand is a Delhi-based businessman and an active member of Sonams closely-knitted circle of friends.
Sonam, who flew down to London for one of her friends engagement, was accompanied by Ahuja. It was during this engagement party that both of them had posed for a picture which was then posted by a leading website.
While Sonam dazzled in a black strapless gown, Anand complemented her in a black suit.
Just recently, Sonam had posted a picture of her holidaying in the States which raised eyebrows. In the picture Sonam was seen wearing a white coloured dress teamed with a denim jacket over her shoulders. When her friends enquired about that jacket, she said it is Anands.
Are they holidaying together, seems like!
