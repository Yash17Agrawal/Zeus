Ever since Gautham Menon and Dhanush announced that they would be collaborating for the first time on a film, there's been a lot of speculation to see how their creative partnership would turn out. And on Sunday, 27 November, Menon and Dhanush offered fans a glimpse of what their collaboration has yielded the first look and posters ofEnai Nokki Paayum Thotta.Dhanush shared the posters on his social media account.Posters of Dhanush and Gautham Menon's Enai Nokki Paayum Thotta. Image courtesy TwitterGautham Menon had previously said thatEnai Nokki Paayum Thotta could be divided into two parts in terms of its storyline. The first is more romantic and fun, while the second is action sequence-heavy. The posters too indicate these two very divergent aspects of the film: Dhanush is clean-shaven and chanelling his romantic persona in two of the posters (one of which features his leading lady Megha Akash); the third shows him angry, bearded, and (presumably) ready to wreak vengeance on the bad guys.The posters reveal another major detail: Enai Nokki Paayum Thotta has been slated for a February 2017 release specifically for Valentine's Day weekend.Deccan Chronicle reports that Thotta will be wrapped up by December-end, and the team is now gearing up for the final shoot schedule. Menon apparently worked on this film alongside his recently released critical and commercial hitAchcham Yenbadhu Madamaiyada.The teaser for Thotta is now expected to be unveiled on 6 December, along with the film's music, at a grand event.The film is produced by Ondraga Entertainment, and also features Rana Daggubati.First Published On : Nov 28, 2016 10:41 IST
