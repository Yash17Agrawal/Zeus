As awinner of Celebrity Big Brother, one might imagine Bollywood starShilpa Shetty would have more than a passing interest in the work of George Orwell.
Shetty was the winning housemate inthe fifth series of the reality TV show, named after the totalitarian leader in Orwell's 1984. During the 2007 seriesshe became the centre of an international row amid accusations she had been the victim ofbullying by fellow housemates Jade Goody, Jo O'Meara and Danielle Lloyd.
She has now become the focal point of a social media storm afterher comments about Orwell's Animal Farm went viral in recent days.
The Mumbai Times askedShetty for her views on the inclusion of characters from popular culture in a new reading syllabus for schoolchildren in India.
