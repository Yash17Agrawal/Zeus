Gautham Vasudev Menon first revealed that he had prepared a script titled Yennai Nokki Paayum Thotta during mid-2013, when he narrated the film to Suriya. The pair opted not to work on the project and instead began pre-production work on another film, Dhruva Natchathiram instead during the period.[2] In March 2016, Gautham Menon announced that he would direct a film, which would now feature Dhanush and Megha Akash in the lead roles.[3][4] Cinematographer Jomon T. John joined the team in March 2016. The project was officially launched on 14 March 2016 in Chennai.[5]
