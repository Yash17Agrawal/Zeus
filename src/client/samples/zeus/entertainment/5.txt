											 Koffee With Karan Season 5: Arjun Kapoor did a cameo on the episode and was left literally touched and moved by Ranbir Kapoor and Ranveer Singh.
One of the main reasons we love Koffee With Karan is because it shows the candid side of the celebs leaving them completely unplugged, apart from giving us all the Bollywood gossips. And just like its previous episodes, Sunday was no different. Amid a lot of laughter and fun, Bollywoods two biggest heartthrobs Ranbir Kapoor and Ranveer Singh bared all while sipping coffee with host Karan Johar.It was the first time these two appeared on a show together. We dont need to mention why the bonding between Ranbir and Ranveer has always remained the talk of the town, with their main connect being Deepika Padukone. We give all the credit to KJo for being able to bring them together on the same couch in the fifth season of Koffee With Karan.

Amidst a lot of jokes, both the actors revealed their crazy side.Lets begin with the way Ranveer Singh and Ranbir Kapoor entered.
1. No, they didnt walk. They danced their way into the show.

 3. Ranbir Kapoor is a poised kid, who sleeps in his pyjamas while Ranveer Singh confidently said that he is a nanga aadmi.

5. The two boys got hugely competitive when they had to kiss Arjun Kapoor. Arjun declared Ranbir as the better kisser, leaving his best friend Ranveer quite heart broken.
6. A thoughtful Ranbir took a moment on whether or not to reveal himself as someone who screwed up things with his friend by sleeping with his girlfriend.
7. When the two had to sing like Farhan Akhtar.

8. When Ranveer forgot the iconic steps of Salman Khan, but Ranbir did not.
9. But he proved himself as a winner while copying Katrina Kaifs step in Chikni Chameli.
10. Finally, Ranveers epic reply to Shah Rukh Khans question, about his padded underwear, made him win the coffee hamper for the first time.
Paris is a cold place and the AC was on. So I had to stuff my underwear. I am just saving them the post production work else they have to do VFX on my Red Chillies, Ranveer replied. It was his solid comeback that singlehandedly won him the rapid fire round.
