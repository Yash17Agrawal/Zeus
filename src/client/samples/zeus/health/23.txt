 CHENNAI: When doctors suggested Radha Ethirajulu to donate her sons organs, the lady refused as she was too engulfed by grief. Then my daughter told me that instead of being consumed by earth, my son could live in another persons body. That was when I decided to donate, she recalled.
She was among the many donors and family members of donors, honoured at an organ donation awareness programme of Apollo Specialty Hospitals in Perungudi on Friday.
Chennai continues to be the at top in organ transplant, with a donation rate of 1.8 per million, three times the national average.
Speaking at the event, Health Minister Dr C Vijay Bhasker, said the State was the first to set up a Transplant Authority (TRANSTAN). Tamil Nadu stands first in Cadaver transplantation with a harvest of 4,992 organs from 893 donors. Even Maharashtra, which is right next to our State in numbers, has harvested only 1,590 organs from 298 donors, he explained. Poor people approaching private hospitals for organ transplants are also taken care of under the CMs comprehensive health insurance scheme, he said.
