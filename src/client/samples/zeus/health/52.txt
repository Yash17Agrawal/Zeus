The Air Quality Index (AQI) over the city on Friday was 196, falling into the unhealthy category. Till now officials have not been able to confirm the cause behind the sudden rise of the pollution levels.
Concerned authorities had banned the construction work across the city. As per the local officials, authorities are likely to inspect the construction sites for any violations of pollution norms.
More stringent measures need to be taken to tackle the pollution problem. Mere ban on construction activities would not help. We need to plant more trees and cleanliness drive across the city needs to be taken more seriously, as told by environmentalist Vivek Kamboj to a national daily.
Earlier during the first week of the month, dense smog had engulfed entire Delhi along with Gurugram and Noida. The thick brown cover was triggered due to Diwali fire crackers and crop burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana along with extremely low wind speed.
Pollution levels were sky high and air quality index rose above 500, falling in the severe category. PM 2.5 levels had gone beyond 800 u/mg and over some areas it had also touched 1100 u/mg.
