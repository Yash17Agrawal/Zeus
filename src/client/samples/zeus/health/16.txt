 CHENNAI: Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, now recuperating after a serious ailment left her indisposed since September 22, is able to speak for a short while, said Apollo Hospitals chairman Prathap C Reddy.
The Chief Minister still has the tracheostomy tube, but she is able to speak for a few seconds through the speaker on the tube, Reddy said on the sidelines of an organ donation awareness event in Chennai on Friday. Those who have to use the tube for long will be trained, but in Jayalalithaas case, it is only temporary, he said. She will soon be able to speak without it, he added.
She was breathing on her own for 90 per cent of the time, he said, adding that the tube was just a matter of precaution.
The Chief Minister is now undergoing whole body physiotherapy, both static and passive. She had severe problems in all her organs but all of them have been solved. Now all she needs is good exercise since she has been in bed for several weeks, he added. There is a set pattern of physiotherapy for each organ; so physiotherapists are encouraging her to do different kinds of exercises. Now we have to wait for her to stand up on her own and start walking.
She was shifted from the ICU to a special ward she is undergoing rehabilitation following recommendation from the team of doctors who attended to her including pulmonologist, nephrologist, cardiologists and other specialists. Some of these doctors didnt go home for two weeks to ensure that she gets the best care, Reddy said.
