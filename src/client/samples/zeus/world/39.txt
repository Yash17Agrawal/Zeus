MANILA Malacaang moved to play down security concerns after an improvised explosive device (IED) was found near the US embassy on Monday.
Police said the bomb was similar to the one used in the explosion which tore through a night market in Davao City in September that killed 15 people.
We assure the public that this incident should not be a cause for alarm. Business and work continue as normal, Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said in a statement.
He said the Philippine National Police was on top of the situation and had taken the necessary steps to tighten security measures in crowded areas.
To ensure public safety in airports, seaports, bus and mass transport terminals, concerned transport agencies are instructed to increase the visibility and presence of uniformed personnel and heighten the screening of persons and luggage as part of our security vigilance, Andanar added. SFM/rga
