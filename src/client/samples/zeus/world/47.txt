Putin, I think, is testing the alliance and we have to respond, he said.
We have to make clear that Nato is a defensive alliance but ultimately it is prepared to come to the defence of those members who feel very vulnerable, particularly on the eastern flank countries like the three Baltic states and Poland in particular.
For members of Nato itself, it is extremely important now that the alliance pulls itself together, Nato members increase their defence spending Poland and Britain actually meet the 2 per cent commitment and that we do reassure those members that feel extremely vulnerable.
