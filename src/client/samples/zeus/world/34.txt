The Balochistan High Court (BHC) Monday (today) issued bailable arrest warrants for former president General (retd) Pervez Musharraf in a case pertaining to Nawab Akbar Bugti murder case. A divisional bench of BHC passed this order during the hearing of review petition challenging the acquittal of the former president by an Anti-Terrorism Court in the case. Justice Jamal Mandokhail and Justice Zaheeruddin Kakar heard a review petition filed by Nawabzada Jamil Bugti, the son of Akbar Bugti. During the court proceedings, Musharrafs counsel Akhtar Shah requested the court to exempt his client from appearing in the court because of security reasons; however, the petitioners counsel complained that despite repeated orders the ex-president failed to appear before the court. Meanwhile, the court also ordered the officials concerned to provide security to the president during his court appearance. The Jamhoori Wattan Party chief Bugti was killed along with his 26 comrades during an operation in the mountains of Dera Bugti in August 2006. The Bugti family charged Musharraf with the murder who, it says, had ordered the military operation. The Bugti murder FIR was registered under Sections 302 and 304 of the Pakistan Penal Code against Musharraf and others in 2009. The case remained dormant until 2011 when the Bugti family moved the Balochistan High Court (BHC) against the lack of progress. Subsequently, the ATC was directed to take up the case.
