 NEW DELHI: After Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Saturday paid lush tributes to the late Cuban icon Fidel Castro - considered a dictator by many - he faced a backlash from social media with several Twitterati imagining how Trudeau might praise other less-than-angelic historical figures.
 
 
 They've even invented a hashtag, #TrudeauEulogies, which they're adding to their deeply sarcastic messages.
 
 
 For instance, the Canadian PM said in a statement Castro was a certainly a larger-than-life figure and a legendary revolutionary and orator.
 
 
 So people wondered what Trudeau might say about terrorist Osama bin Laden.
 
 
 
 Osama Bin Laden was certainly a controversial figure, but his contribution to airport security is unparalleled.

 Trudeau's statement did say Castro was a controversial leader, but he was widely criticized for his remarks, especially by members of his main political opponents: the Canadian Conservative Party.
 
 
 Trudeau should have mentioned the Fidel Castro regime's brutal, oppressive, and murderous history, rather than describing him as if reading from a storybook, said Kellie Leitch, a Conservative MP.
 
 
 These Twitterati weren't impressed either.

 Trudeau defended his statement on Sunday, saying he'd never hesitated to bring up human rights, as he'd done directly with Cuban President Raul Castro recently.
 
 
 When he was asked whether he thought Castro was a dictator, he simply answered, Yes.
 
 
 Trudeau explained that Castro was a polarizing figure, in whose time there were significant concerns about human rights, and this was something he was open about and had highlighted.
 
 
 I believe in positive, constructive engagement in the world, and that means being open and direct in our assessments, in our challenges, in our points of disagreement- while at the same time, being consistent with the kind of respect that Canadians expect from the Prime Minister, he said.
 
 
 The same kind of respect with which Twitterati had written their 'TrudeauEulogies'
